# aSlope

A small library to perform simple slope stability calculations
Code adapted to methods given in NTNU course BYGX2001
- this is by no means a finished projects so check all results carefully


## Instructions
The main.py script contains examples of calculations for a simple geometry.

## Examples
This code can be used to calculate factor of safety for sircular cylindric failure surfaces

using bot undrained strength parameters (Su)

and drained parameters

The most critical FS can be found with a simple grid search
